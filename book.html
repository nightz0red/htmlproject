            <p> True genius, the kind that seems to be gifted by the gods, inspires awe, not envy. We watch it with a kind of joy that is hard to describe, and we don’t blame ourselves for it because the gift is beyond understanding, and it is beyond comprehension. There is no self-consciousness in it; it is enjoyment.

                In his book Messi, Luca Caioli gets as close as possible to Lionel Messi’s genius. Originally published in Spain in 2008, Argentina in 2009, and an English language edition in 2010 from Icon Books, the book has been updated to include the action and moments of the 2019–2020 season, and is available wherever good books are sold.. </p>
